# Random Forest Structural Ensemble Scoring

Novel method to assess the convergence of protein structural ensembles using random forests.

_caconversion.py_ provides the necessary code to convert an ensemble into a set of pairwise Alpha-Carbon distances suitable for scoring. 

This is passed to _forestscore.py_ which returns the probability-based score.
